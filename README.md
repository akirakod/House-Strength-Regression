Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.

    Number of instances 1030
    Number of Attributes 9
    Attribute breakdown 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable

The aim of the dataset is to predict concrete compressive strength of high performance concrete (HPC). HPC does not always means high strength but covers all kinds of concrete for special applications that are not possible with standard concretes. Therefore, our target value is:

Target Y(Strength of house)

    Concrete compressive strength [MPa]

In this case the compressive strength is the cylindrical compressive strength meaning a cylindrical sample (15 cm diameter; 30 cm height) was used for testing. The value is a bit smaller than testing on cubic samples. Both tests assess the uniaxial compressive strength. Usually, we get both values if we buy concrete.

To predict compressive strengths, we have these features available:

Input X(Features):

Cement [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Blast furnace slag [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Fly ask [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Water [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Plasticizer [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Coarse aggregate [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Fine aggregate [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Age [𝑑]
