Linear Regression : Important features that measure the concrete compressive strength of a house 

Target Y(Strength of house)

Concrete compressive strength [MPa]

To predict compressive strengths, we have these features available:

Input X(Features):

Cement [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Blast furnace slag [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Fly ask [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Water [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Plasticizer [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Coarse aggregate [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Fine aggregate [𝑘𝑔𝑚3]
Age [𝑑]
